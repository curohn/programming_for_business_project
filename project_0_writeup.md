3. How does the organization currently work to solve the problem (if any)? How will your
solution fit into their current process and help them improve the outcomes?

Currently at Zillow we use a mixture of techniques to help identify current market conditions. We mostly focus on traditional apprasials, comparative market analyses, and public records & tax assessments to help determine the current value of a home. In tradtional appraisals we used a mixture of in person inspections, local sale comps and consider condition/upgrades to help account for the houses fair market value. Using comparative market analyses we would use recent sales, current listings, and expired listings combined with local knowlege to prepare a home and evaluation. If the other two methods failed to bring a clear valuation we would fall to tax assessments on the property and public sale records to find a property value. 

6. How will you process your data, in real-time or in batches? Give an overview of the data,
e.g., data types, variables, labels, etc. What kind of preprocessing techniques will you apply
and why?

We would likely process the data in batches as we don't immediately need years upon years of data, but rather recent property values and relevant home conditions to help understand where the property would fall in terms of value for the area. 

Our data will pull the following data t

9. How will the organization be expected to utilize your solution in their workflow? What is
the capacity requirement for the company to utilize your solution?

At Zillow we could use the database as a supplemental tool in our research when evaluating a property. Essentially we would use it as a baseline valuse adjusting for current market conditions and property conditions.
